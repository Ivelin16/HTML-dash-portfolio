<h1>The Best Movies According To Ivelin</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Chunking express</h3>
<p>Perfect movie, intimate but not claustrophobic, bittersweet but not sad, funny, but not silly, ultimately, nothing more or less what life feels like.</p>

<h3>Wings of Desire</h3>
<p>A movie much about an angel living on top of Berlin but without having the human experience. He can only hear people's worries and thought but ultimately he cannot help him. He wants to experience life and basically he wants to fall down from heaven to experience the human life. Beautiful movie.</p>

<h3>Before the rain</h3>
<p>Balkan context, loved it. 3 different powerful stories, interconnected. Really shows the human flaws.</p>
